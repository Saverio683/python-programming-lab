    "A canvas is a rectangular area within a window in which the programmer can perform graphics operations, such as drawing geometric shapes, text, and so forth.  A canvas can also detect mouse events, such as button presses and releases, mouse cursor movement, and mouse dragging (pressing mouse button and moving the mouse cursor simultaneously).  Canvases are useful for decorating windows, displaying graphs and charts, developing interactive sketchpads, and other graphics-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A canvas uses a screen coordinate system.  Unlike the Cartesian coordinate system, the origin (0,0) for screen coordinates is in the upper left corner of the drawing area.  The x-axis and is at the top boundary of the canvas and the y-axis is its the left boundary.  The x values increase to the right, as usual, but the y values increase to the bottom.  For example, the point (50, 50) is located 50 pixels to the right of the y-axis and 50 pixels below the x-axis.  Negative coordinates exist but are not viewable outside of the boundaries of a canvas.  The window can be resized to view positive coordinates that lie beyond the current right and bottom boundaries of a canvas.\n",

    "The primary canvas resource in breezypythongui is the EasyCanvas class.  This class provides all of the capabilities of Python’s tkinter.canvas, as well as some useful extensions.  These extensions allow the beginner to draw simple geometric shapes and text, as well as respond to mouse events. \n",

    "There are two basic design patterns for adding canvasses to an application.  The first pattern works well for applications that simply draw shapes or other graphical outputs to a canvas.  In this pattern, the application adds a canvas to the window and runs methods to draw on it.  For example, a simple demo application allows the user to draw filled blue ovals and red text messages at random positions on a gray canvas.  The window shown in the next screen shot places the canvas across the top row, above three command buttons labeled Draw oval, Draw text, and Clear all.  The last button deletes and erases all of the drawings on the canvas."

The background color of the canvas is then set to gray, and the three command buttons are added.  \n",

An instance of this class is then added to the window, as the optional canvas argument to the addCanvas method.  When a mouse event occurs in the canvas, the corresponding handler method is triggered.  Default handler methods that do nothing are also defined in EasyCanvas, but if the programmer overrides the relevant method in her subclass, the application can then respond to the event appropriately.
